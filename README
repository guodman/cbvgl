To change the resolution, open cbvgl.Core and change the resWidth and resHeight lines to the width and height that you would like.

Running the application:
java -Djava.library.path=/path/to/natives/ -Xmx256m -jar cbvgl.jar

If you experience out of memory errors, you can increase the maximum heap size by changing the number after the -Xmx.
